"Final Application" contains the final solution for out project, it is the program that will run and display the graph GUI.

The Final application uses Graph A Large, and uses an Stack with an array implementation.

Graph A/B Large/Medium/Small are the graphs that we used to test the time complexity and space complexity of each data structure.

"Space Complexity Test" shows the code that we used to display the RAM usage of each data structure.

"Time Complexity Test" shows the code that we used to display the nanosecond runtime of each data structure.

Each data structure will also be displayed, and samples of the working code as a WHOLE has also been displayed.
